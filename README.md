# Tweet-Bot
Telegram Bot for predicting whether the news is Fake or Not using Logistic Regression and open LLM with the help of aiogram module.

## Problem Statement
There is a rise in fake news generation that is causing chaos in different domains of life. People blindly believe whatever is being said and come up with false conclusions. 
Twitter and WhatsApp are the core of false information and the authenticity of any information forwarded or tweeted is unverified.
It leads to chaos as the common public starts spreading false information and ends up understanding/believing unverified facts. This will have a dire effect on the nation's economy and lead to its downfall. There is a need to curb the spread and generation of fake news and this change is being felt widely.

## Idea
‘Tweetbot’ is a chatbot that takes in the user input as messages/news and predicts whether it is genuine or not.
Tweetbot is an Open LLM-powered conversational agent designed to assist users in identifying and verifying the credibility of news and information circulating online. 
Its primary goal is to combat the spread of misinformation, disinformation, and fake news that can mislead people and create social unrest. This bot is designed to safeguard people from the perils of misinformation and fake news spreading on popular social media platforms like Twitter and WhatsApp. 
The bot can be integrated as a feature to social media as an extension or as a separate mobile application.
